# Quick Note Plugin

The following plugin is a very early stage Obsidian plugin meant to accelerate the speed of note taking and linking with additional features. The core features are:

- **Find Possible Aliases**: By clicking the icon on the left side, a list of all display names used for the current page but not added as an alias are shown with options to add them to the aliases metadata of that note.
- **Solidify Links**: By clicking the icon on the left side, one can take all the links to a current page and change them so that if the link is [[XYZ]] it is converted to [[XYZ|XYZ]] ensuring that even if this note's name is changed that the display names of its links will not be automatically changed but the actual link to the page will.
- **Silently Create Note**: To avoid needing to pan to another page, highlight a selection, right click and select this option which will create the note but not pan over to the page.
- **Silently Create Note with Different Name**: Same as silently create note but with the ability to change the name of the note
- **Link to Note as Alias**: To link a display name to some alias and possibly add it into the aliases attribute, highlight a selection, right click and select this option.
